The project presents a set of 'biographies' of iconic objects associated with the Mao era in China (1949-76), ranging from common, prosaic types - washbasins, bricks, badges - to the particular or unusual such as the Beijing International Club, and the Chinese character typewriter. Each biography centres on a capsule essay written by an academic with experience working with that object.
An important target audience for the site is secondary level students studying Chinese history. Keeping text on the home page to a minimum and providing instead an eye-catching grid of images was a way for KDL to present the scope of the collection whilst inviting exploration of individual objects.
