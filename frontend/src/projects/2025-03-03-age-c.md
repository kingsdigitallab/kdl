AGE-C conducts research on ageing and gender in European cinema and fosters public discourse on aging and gender in European cinema by curating festival programs for different famous international venues. \n KDL worked with this international team of researchers to develop an intuitive data exploration interface from their spreadsheet sources, normalising data to enable faceted search and visualisation.
