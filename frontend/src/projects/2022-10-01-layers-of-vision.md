Layers of Vision was an art exhibition mounted at the Arcade at Bush House on the Strand featuring artworks which celebrated and creatively explored accessibility. The exhibition, timed to coincide with UK Disability History Month, was based on an ongoing research project exploring the experiences and perspectives of blind and partially sighted artists. KDL built the project website, incorporating a look and feel created by Praline design studio and paying particular attention to aspects of digital accessibility.
