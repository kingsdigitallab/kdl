The aim of the project was to explore the use of digital tools to examine, and to represent, shared ideas, concepts, axioms and apophthegms in various cultures with a focus on the Byzantine Greek and medieval Arabic worlds, looking at the transmission of such materials, largely drawn from the Classical Greek world.

Each literary researcher worked on the manuscripts of their various texts, to produce digital editions. The technical team developed the ontology (principally work by Anna Jordanous) and used it in order to represent the connections between those texts, and to build a structure for representing the texts (the Dynamic Library).
