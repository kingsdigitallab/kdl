Focusing on the Shakespeare-related holdings in the Royal Collection and Royal Archives the project assesses what they tell us, individually and collectively, about the relationship between the cultural afterlife of Shakespeareâ€™s works and the royal family from 1714 (the accession of George I) to the present. KDL built a customized Autharch backend for creating and storing object records.
This repository underpins the frontend which showcases the metadata together with images provided by the Royal Collection, and it also provides for exporting the object metadata as EAD3 XML.
