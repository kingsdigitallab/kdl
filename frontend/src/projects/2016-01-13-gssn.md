GSSN serves as a hub for the circulation of knowledge and discussion about German-language film. The German Screen Studies Network engages in outreach for German language training, including engagement with schools, and the website is a resource base for schools liaison and recruitment activities, as well as for industry professionals and members of the lay public who wish to learn more about German film. To meet the brief for a website that was attractive to the visitor and structurally sustainable KDL kept functionality simple and aimed for a clean, minimalist design to convey the project rationale whilst hinting at the strong arthouse heritage of German cinema.
