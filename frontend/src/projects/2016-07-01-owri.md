Language Acts and Worldmaking was a large-scale project, one of the four programmes funded by UKRI's Open World Research Initiative to 'demonstrate the value of modern languages in a globalised research environment'. The project had a large team of researchers forming six active research strands, along with a group of sixteen partners. The website needed to convey the breadth and depth of the programme as well as showcase its numerous activities and events.
