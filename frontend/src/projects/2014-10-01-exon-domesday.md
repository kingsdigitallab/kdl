The aim of this project was to publish the contents of the Exon Domesday Book for the first time and to unlock the evidence which the book contains for the conduct of the Domesday survey (1086) at both local and central level.

The online resource contains the new digital edition the book, its translation and a complete set of high resolution images. It also offers palaeographical annotations of the text and detailed and comprehensive codicological description of each folio. The material can be searched through the rich analytical metadata associated with each entry and custom-made tools to visualise and compare them.
