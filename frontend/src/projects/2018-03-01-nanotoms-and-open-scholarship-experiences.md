The Nanotoms project will prototype tools for exposing multimedia digital assets representing objects and texts in a way that includes narrative metadata (both provided by a research team and algorithmically generated), which in turn will allow more creative, experimental, accessible, multi-modal expressions of the data, linking to the future published volumes and potentially to other mixed digital and physical interfaces in the future.
