Digital Ghost Hunt is a mixture of coding education, Augmented Reality and live performance in an immersive storytelling experience.
Elliott Hall served as Creative Technologist on the project, leading development on the AR and IoT devices as well as co-writing the show with Tom Bowtell. DGH was designed to test a model of Digital Creativity co-creation with the Creative Industries, and was incubated in the lab's 10% personal research program.
