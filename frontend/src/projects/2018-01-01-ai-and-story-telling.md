  description: A surreal landscape of snowy cliffs with jagged mountain peaks
    under a vibrant gradient sky that shifts from orange to pink and purple.
    People wearing old-fashioned expedition clothing pull ropes across the snow,
    helping others traverse a crevice of circuits and wires. Tall transmission
    towers rise from the mountaintops, and in the depths of the canyon below, a
    grid of electronic circuits is melting the snow.

An exciting fusion of creative writing and artificial intelligence to help writers create new forms of dynamic, interactive stories. An Innovate-funded collaboration between game company Charisma.AI, immersive company Parabolic Theatre, and King's College London, it specifically aimed to understand what the impact of artificially-intelligent memory is on storytelling and narrative structure, and how to transfer the resulting research into industry.

KDL Director James Smithies was PI on the project, while Senior RSE Elliott Hall was Co-I, serving as the head writer and technical consultant for two showcase demos in Unity created to refine the Charisma platform: For King & Country and The Kraken Wakes.

An article based on this project, "[Applied Digital Humanities and the Creative Industries in the United Kingdom](https://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000628/000628.html)" By Smithies, Atkinson, and Hall, is now available in Issue 16.2 of Digital Humanities Quarterly
