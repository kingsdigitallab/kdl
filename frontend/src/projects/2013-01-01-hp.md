The Redress of the Past is the first comprehensive treatment of historical pageantry in Britain, from its modern origins in 1905 to the present. Engagement with people who had attended or taken part in pageants was a key focus of the editorial team and they worked closely with local communities and institutions, putting on exhibitions and soliciting personal accounts and memorabilia. A database which stores & makes accessible in one place the extensive research data collected by the project scholars forms the core of the online resource, along with recorded interviews and a large number of pageant-related images.
