Funded by the Wellcome Trust, the Renaissance Skin project used an interdisciplinary, medical humanities approach to study changing notions of human and animal skin in Europe between 1450-1700. In building a website to present their research topics and activities, KDL tried to integrate the important project theme of skin as both porous and a barrier into the overall design itself.
