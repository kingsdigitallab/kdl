The Sudan Memory project seeks to conserve and promote valuable cultural materials from and about Sudan through digitisation and via [an online platform](https://www.sudanmemory.org/). Throughout the country, many interesting and rich archives are at risk for a number of reasons: extreme weather conditions, lack of appropriate storage conditions, neglect and conflict. Many public and private collections are also locked away and not easily accessible.

The Sudan Memory project mission is to help preserve these archives and their stories, so that current and future generations can benefit from this precious and important heritage.

KDL's involvement was principally through advice to the project team to support the development of the Sudan Memory digital resource. The Lab also takes part in broader discussions around sustainability of the Sudan Memory website and future projects that are being developed from the work already undertaken to capture and preserve Sudanese heritage.
