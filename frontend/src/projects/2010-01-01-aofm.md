The Art of Making in Antiquity is a digital project focused on studying Roman stoneworking. It features a photographic archive by Peter Rockwell and explores the carving process, production methods, and the people behind the works. The resource includes around 2,000 images of Roman monuments and contextual sources, along with an analysis of the techniques used in their creation.
