The project sought to explore the potential for communicating exhibits, stories and personal experiences using immersive technology. It focused on transmitting, replicating, or otherwise porting, the Room to Breathe temporary exhibition showing at the UK Migration Museum.
Target audiences included children in group participation activities at their schools, lay-persons wishing to experience an exhibition remotely from their homes, and partner museums interested in sharing ideas, exhibits and artefacts in real-time, or in recreating museum experiences at a distance.
