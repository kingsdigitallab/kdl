DisCouRSE is an UKRI-funded Network+ project that encourages and supports the development of leaders across all digital Research Technical Professional (dRTP) roles, resulting in an empowered and connected community equipped to shape the future of digital research.\n\nBy focusing on leadership, career pathways, and community collaboration, DisCouRSE will help address long-standing challenges around recognition, progression, and sustainability in the many roles essential to make effective use of the UK’s digital research infrastructure. The network consider a broad definition of leadership, encompassing strategic, community, and technical leadership, not just management.\n\nThe project brings together partners from academia, the public sector, industry, and international networks to ensure broad impact and relevance. \n\nThe role of King's Digital Lab in collaboration with e-Research at King's College London will be to contribute to the project leadership and in particular to work package 4 (careers) by running focus groups about processes and practices used within digital RTP groups. These could be processes around leadership and strategy (e.g. team structures and roles) as well as Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) processes (e.g. requirements elicitation, project templates, incubation of experimental work) and technical approaches (e.g. development approach, web accessibility) generalisable beyond single research domains. To find out more and get involved visit the [DiscouRSE webpages](https://discourse-network.github.io/workpackages/).
