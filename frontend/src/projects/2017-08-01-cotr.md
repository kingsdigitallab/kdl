_The Community of the Realm in Scotland_ aims to show how new ways of representing medieval texts in digital media can yield new understandings of medieval political communities and their written manifestations. KDL created means for capturing and displaying change through historic versions of a text, allowing scholars to see where unsettled areas of the text mark places of contested significance.
