The Australian Cultural Data Engine aims to harness and interrogate data from a range of cultural databases to help researchers, industry and government get a 'big picture' of, and gain insight into, the spectrum of cultural production and participation in Australia. KDL hosted workshops to help the project develop RSE best practice as a central aim of the proposed infrastructure research, and used its convening power to bring together London technology sector partners, researchers, and software engineers to identify research and commercial collaboration opportunities.
