Europe has a long and rich tradition as a centre for the Arts & Humanities. However, the digital transformation poses challenges to the Arts & Humanities research landscape all over the world. Responding to these challenges, the Digital Research Infrastructure for Arts & Humanities (DARIAH) was launched as a pan-European network and research infrastructure. After expansion and consolidation, which involved DARIAH’s inscription on the ESFRI roadmap, DARIAH became a European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC) in August 2014. The DESIR project - DARIAH ERIC Sustainability Refined - sets out to strengthen the sustainability of DARIAH and firmly establish it as a long-term leader and partner within Arts & Humanities communities.

King’s Digital Lab, along with the University of Glasgow, are leading in the development of strategies for European research engagement in the next decade and beyond. We have been working closely with domestic initiatives and engaging with other institutions and UK DARIAH cooperating partners to promote an agenda of continued European collaboration, and to secure a new level of advocacy for the Digital Humanities.

We have been seeking consensus from across the UK Arts & Humanities digital research community through a series of workshops, to identify the most suitable models for close UK-European collaboration in the wake of Brexit.
