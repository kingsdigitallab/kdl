The Software Sustainability Institute Fellowship supports research with a small fund over a 15-month period. This proposal investigates issues with, and possible solutions to, UI/UX design workflow integration into software development lifecycle.

KDL research focuses in particular on the current set up of research and development units and the roles considered within it. How some of these roles are not explicitly exposed, for instance designers, project managers and often analysts, and what a formal recognition of these roles could mean in terms of contribution, more efficient ways of working and quality of the final products.
