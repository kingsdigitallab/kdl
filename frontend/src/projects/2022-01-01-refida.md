The REF 2021 Impact Data Analysis was a small project, between King's Digital Lab (KDL) and colleagues in the King's College London (KCL) Research Management & Innovation Directorate (RMID), to support the analysis of the college's [REF 2021](https://results2021.ref.ac.uk/) impact case studies and environment statements.

The data used during the development of this project includes 153 impact case studies and environment statements, in PDF (5-10 pages of text each), which follow [standard templates](https://www.ref.ac.uk/publications-and-reports/guidance-on-submissions-201901/) but are expressed with heterogeneous descriptions and language.

The project was set up to help RMID and research impact leads to address the questions:

- What are the main types of impact KCL has delivered? Which pathways have been used to deliver those impacts?
- Who are our key partners and beneficiaries of our impacts?
- Where are they - local (London), national or global?
- Is there a correlation between discipline and types of impact or pathways to impact used?
- What are the areas identified as strengths, areas for development and future plans?
