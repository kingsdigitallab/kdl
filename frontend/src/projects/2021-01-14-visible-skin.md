'Visible Skin' showcases the work of artist Peter Brathwaite in collaboration with the King’s Renaissance Skin research project and King’s Culture. Funded by the Wellcome Trust, the exhibition has been curated by Dr Hannah Murphy, Department of History in the Faculty of Arts & Humanities. KDL developed the online component to augment the physical exhibition, integrating the online exhibition into the existing Renaissance Skin website. Image transitions are used in the online gallery display to accentuate the similarities and differences between each original painting and Brathwaite's reimagining of it.
