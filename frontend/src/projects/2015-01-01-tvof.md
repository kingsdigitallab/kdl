TVOF's overall research interest was the role of French as a supralocal, transnational language, particularly in Western Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean, during a crucial period, 1100-1450. The team approached this topic through the creation of a digital edition of a complex and widely disseminated textual tradition vital to medieval understandings of European history and identity, the _Histoire ancienne jusqu’à César_. KDL created interfaces to display alignments of content segments across the edition, and collaborated with colleagues from _Dictionnaire étymologique de l’ancien français_ (DEAF) in building a workflow which assisted the project scholars to lemmatise the encoded text.
