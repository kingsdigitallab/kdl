Archetype (formerly known as 'The DigiPal Framework') was an open source web application for the structured annotation, presentation retrieval and analysis of units of visual communication. KDL no longer maintains this legacy framework. Its constituent features and underlying concepts may inspire new, modular palaeographical tools in the future.

The software has been used by around 20 projects worldwide, in languages and scripts including Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Cuneiform, Japanese and Mayan. The underlying system also won a prize from the Medieval Academy of America in 2017.
