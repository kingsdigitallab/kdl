_Room is Sad_ is an interactive immersive experience that uses AI and the Internet of Things (IoT) to tell the story of a smart room that isn’t feeling itself, encouraging players to talk to the Room and discover what might be wrong. Room is Sad is a humorous, accessible way to engage both an academic and general audience on questions of identity, autonomy, privacy, and intelligence. The project is the second collaboration between King’s Digital Lab (KDL) and game company [Charisma AI](https://charisma.ai/), building on their earlier work on the Innovate-funded [AI & Storytelling](https://aiandstorytelling.com/) project.
