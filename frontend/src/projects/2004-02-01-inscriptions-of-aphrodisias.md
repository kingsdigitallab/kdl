Under this page we collect information about several projects related to the publication over several years of Late Antique inscriptions from the excavations at Aphrodisias in Caria (Western Asia Minor, western Turkey today).

An enhanced online edition was produced in 2004 and in 2007 a full corpus of all the texts known to the researchers followed. These were all edited in EpiDoc XML, under the guidance of Gabriel Bodard.
