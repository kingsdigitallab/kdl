This project was the result of a partnership between the BM and the Trust for African Rock Art (TARA), made possible with funding from Arcadia Fund. It sought to curate the around 23,000 images, originally from TARA, and provide valuable context to the diversity of rock art forms found across the African continent to ensure global open access to this extensive collection.
More information on the project and KDL contribution can be found in the blogpost linked on this page.
