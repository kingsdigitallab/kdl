We may also receive information about you from third parties, for example from a friend who wants to tell you about our website.

KDL may use your personal data to resolve technical issues you encounter, to respond to your requests for assistance, and to repair and improve our service.

## 5 Do we use 'Cookies'?

Cookies are text files, which identify a user's computer to our server. Cookies in themselves do not identify the individual user, just the computer used. The KDL website uses cookies for collecting user information.

The KDL website uses persistent cookies - these are used to track returning visitors. They expire after 12 months and enable us to compare website traffic from month to month. To see more about our cookies - visit the detailed [cookie use page](/cookie-use/).

This website uses Google analytics to help us understand our web traffic. This does not permit storage of an individual's personal data, but will recognise repeated website visits from the same internet address. KDL's policy is to retain this information for a period of 5 years to effectively monitor website traffic and website impact and outreach.

You can reject cookies. Most browsers allow you to refuse cookies - consult the help section of the browser toolbar. Information on controlling cookies or rejecting cookies is available from several web sites, e.g. [http://www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org)

## 6 How do we protect personal information?

We also take appropriate measures to ensure that the information disclosed to us is kept secure, accurate and up to date and kept only for so long as is necessary for the purposes for which it is used. These measures include, but are not limited to, password protected server access, limited firewall access to servers, and a regular server and software update and patch cycle to mitigate against evolving security risks.

## 7 Will we disclose the information we collect to outside parties?

We may store some of your information with external service providers.

To ensure we provide the best user experience we may use the services of external providers for project management tools and workflow. We use ActiveCollab to track project progress and record tasks and issues. ActiveCollab’s security measures can be found here: [https://activecollab.com/security](https://activecollab.com/security)

Some personal information may also be stored securely using Google's Google Drive service. Their Privacy Policy can be viewed here: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
