## Introduction

Between the months of May and October of 2024, I had the valuable opportunity to develop part of my PhD thesis as a visiting post-graduate researcher at King’s College London (KCL), through a scholarship granted by the Doctorate Sandwich Program from CAPES, agency from the Brazilian Ministry of Education. Under the guidance of Prof. Stephanie Janes, from Department of Culture, Media and Creative Industries, and supported by Neil Jakeman, and the King’s Digital Lab (KDL) team under the direction of Dr. Arianna Ciula, I was able to conduct activities that immensely benefited the final, analytical phase of my research, originally based in the post-graduate course of design of the Faculty of Architecture, Urbanism and Design of University of Sao Paulo - FAU USP.
