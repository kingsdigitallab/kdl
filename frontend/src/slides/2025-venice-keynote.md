## Reflections

  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">Careeer pipelines</li>
    <li class="fragment">Labour conditions</li>
    <li class="fragment">Research cultures</li>
    <li class="fragment">Communities</li>
  </ul>

<aside class="notes">

- it takes people and processes to sustain a research infrastructure
- but also an adequate research culture
- mention recent paper about reframing failure
- re point 1: data, systems AND processes; design and analysis - mention carreer pathways: "Mismatch between increasingly digital lifecycle of projects and the career pipelines that would provide the expertise to design, develop and maintain those lifecycles. This failure bears a question and a call for action addressed mainly to those who lead teaching and training programmes: are we working towards creating the profiles of the digital RTPs we need? DH could contribute quite substantially to shaping holistic and diverse profiles by giving weight not only to data and systems but to process-oriented teaching and training and by including design and analysis skills in education strategies."
- re point 2: "Precarity of labour associated with technical roles. Here the overtly open critique is addressed to senior management of the higher education sector (a sector I am conscious I represent) as well as of comparable independent research organisations operating in the arts, humanities and cultural heritage research domains: can digital RTPs in these domains become more mainstream than a few laboratories and ad hoc figures with no defined roles and career progression? While we cannot compete with industry remunerations, benefits including inclusive and stimulating research environments, career paths and opportunities ought to be defined and offered systematically across institutions."
- re point 3: mention conservative / discriminatory academic cultures, promotion systems, evaluation frameworks, funding streams, attitues, behaviours - "Outdated, if not discriminatory, research cultures that are unable or unwilling to value the integral role technical objects play in knowledge production and therefore to value complementary digital research outputs including software (Hidden REF n.d.; Tasovac et al. 2023; Ciula, Esposito and Wijaya 2024) and those experts that have an intimate knowledge of how these objects work or break (Smithies et al. 2023). This borderline discriminatory research culture goes beyond DH and is reflected in our academic promotions systems and evaluation frameworks but also in funding streams and, more subtly, yet with substantial implications, in attitudes, habits and behaviours."
- re point 4: "Individualist research focus which discourages creative, responsible and collaborative re-use and reduces collective impact to unidirectional dissemination activities. Linked to the point above, this relates to the difficulty of reforming research and education environments to work with (and not only for) communities. Experts cognisant of the importance of participatory and imaginative design methods are needed to achieve this reform and ultimately contribute to living well with technology collectively."
