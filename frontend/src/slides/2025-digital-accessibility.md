## History

- 2019: KDL's began an [approach to accessibility](https://emckclac.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/AHkdlfa/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B2F4D65D9-066F-440B-B50A-8F23F446470C%7D&file=Accessibility%20-%20Index%20Page.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)

  - Approximately 10 members in 12 month period (2 solely on accessibility for 6 months). With similar resources, estimated 4-5 years to complete [70+ more post projects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1--ku5lYoGUA-bGzK9xtziqd_dg0uFgYxyBKctEyuq3E/edit?gid=980906287#gid=980906287).

  - Double checked legal compliance, Not legally required. Kept similar commitment but post project work was shifted to SLA [approach](https://app.clickup.com/26475560/v/dc/t7z18-23888/t7z18-112148).

## Strategy

Our objective is to **cultivate a digital environment** that **enhances usability, inclusivity, and full compliance with accessibility standards**. The introduction of [new government regulations](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/contents/made) in 2018 prompted us at King’s Digital Lab to formally strengthen our accessibility approach.

Through continuous iterations, our current strategy aims to reach and benefit the broadest possible audience, supporting accessibility in a sustainable, scalable way, integrating it comprehensively with our Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and Agile methodology. We actively research the latest resources and seek user feedback to understand the needs and challenges with our digital offerings. This ongoing engagement informs our improvement updates to ensure alignment with evolving best practices and accessibility standards.

## 1\. **Requirements**

SDLC stage: Feasibility

Roles: _Lead_ **_A_**_, Collaborate_ **_E U_**_, Consult_ **_S_**

### Determine the MoSCoW Digital Accessibility requirement needed during Feasibility

Questionnaire could be given to partners at this stage<br> <br>
Estimates need to be updated to adapt for different project budgets/timelines

{% endslide %}

{% slide %}

## SHOULD (**S**)

- meet WCAG **A/AA** criteria for **some** components (some might not meet)
- perform specific accessibility assessments during evolutionary development
- produce a public accessibility **statement** and update it at each deployment
- Estimate **3 days** = A 0.6 | E 1.2 | U 1.2<hr>

        ✔ Has more than 5 users

        ✔ Has 1st party apps/platforms

        ✘ Not only non-complex components

{% endslide %}

{% slide %}

### WCAG

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), developed by the World Wide Web Consortium, are technical standards that help make the digital world accessible to people with disabilities. Numerous stakeholders, including disability advocacy groups, government agencies, and accessibility research organizations, collaborated to create these guidelines, which are considered the universal standard for digital accessibility.

- WCAG Versions 1.0 (1999), 2.0 (2008), 2.1 (2018) and 2.2 (2023)

- Three Levels of WCAG Conformance: A (minimum), AA (mid), and AAA (highest)

## 2. **Scope**

[SLDC stage: Kick off]

Roles: _Lead_ **_A_**_, Collaborate_ **_E U_**_, Consult_ **_R_**

### Discuss with project team and determine what will be assessed during project Kick off

The scope should be checked at different points in the project, especially if there are changes to the requirements, to see if it still fits.

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Target Users</td>
<td>We have three primary user groups. 2 with unique needs, a keyboard-only user and a screen reader user.</td>

<td>User Journeys</td>
<td>The team identifies Browsing and Searching as critical flows because they are essential to users’ ability navigate the catalogue, using search filters, and viewing metadata.</td>

<tr>
<td>Document Content and Formats</td>
<td>There will be many images so ensure partners provide alt text (give them guidance and resources), ensure images are in the right file format, does not exceed maximum size and dimensions</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Third-Party Components</td>
<td>The team flags an interactive map and an embedded chatbot for additional accessibility testing.</td>

<td>A - Check process and update statement. Ensure partners check their content meet guidelines.<br>E - Run automated accessibility tests in axe on all pages and manual keyboard testing<br>U - Check all font sizes are large enough, design for dark and light mode, small and large screens, with sufficient colour constrast on all elements.</td>

## 3\. **Assess/Fix**

[SDLC stage: Evolutionary Development]

Role: _Lead_ **_E U_**_, Collaborate_ **_A_**

All assessment and fixes should be integrated seamlessly, continuously when designing and developing within the evolutionary development work, ensuring checks are done before any deployment/increment.

{% endslide %}

{% slide %}

- **Assess**

  - **Automated Testing**: Use automated [accessibility tools](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/tools/list/) (like WAVE, Axe, WebVal or Lighthouse) to identify some common issues, such as missing alt text, insufficient colour contrast, or missing form labels. These tools provide a broad initial scan but capture only a minority of the accessibility issues.

  - **Manual Testing**: Conduct manual checks to identify issues automated tools may miss, such as keyboard navigation functionality, zoom factors, screen reader compatibility, dynamic content accessibility (e.g. hover states, text over image). This stage often includes testing with assistive technology like screen readers (e.g., JAWS or NVDA) and magnifiers.

  - Stand alone assessments (fixes done separately) should be documented in CU.

- **Fix** when issue is found, **if possible** (depending on budget, time, skills, ...), is usually best.

  - Any issues that cannot be fixed should be recorded directly to the statement.

  - Tools and methods should also be recorded in the statement.

{% endslide %}

{% slide %}

## 4\. **Documentation**

### [Evolutionary Development]

_Lead_ **_A_**_, Collaborate_ **_E U_**_, Consult_ **_PM R_**

{% endslide %}

{% slide %}

- Github

  - `fix(a11y): Added missing alt attribute to first image on About page`

- Statement

  - First deployment should have the barebones statement

  - Refer back to Scope table to check if decisions/level planned at the time match delivered solution

  - Issues that are not fixed should be recorded

  - Tools and methods should be recorded

{% endslide %}

{% slide %}

- Recent KDL examples:

  - using the [gov.uk template](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/model-accessibility-statement) took a long time to fill in, difficult to understand. [Alice Thornton](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/accessibility/), [COTR](https://cotr.ac.uk/accessibility-statement/)

  - using [generator tool](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/generator/#create) took shorter time but lots of repetition. [King's Past](https://kingspast.kcl.ac.uk/accessibility-statement), [Radical Translation](https://radicaltranslations.org/accessibility-statement/), [King's Digital Lab](https://kdl.kcl.ac.uk/accessibility-statement/)

  - Very minimal example on [Living with Machines](https://observablehq.com/@jmiguelv/language-of-mechanisation)

## Observations

- Inconsistent outputs (All or nothing approach)

  - very different processes

  - dependant of who was on the project

- Deprioritisation/Avoidance

  - Feasibility - Reasons were given that accessibility wasn't needed in project requirements

  - Evolutionary Development - Not prioritised, often left to the end where there would be no time to work on
