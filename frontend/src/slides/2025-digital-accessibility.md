## History

- 2019: KDL's began an [approach to accessibility](https://emckclac.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/AHkdlfa/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B2F4D65D9-066F-440B-B50A-8F23F446470C%7D&file=Accessibility%20-%20Index%20Page.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)
- 2020 early: Designer hired for 6 months, and Intern
- 2020 late: [Review meetings](https://emckclac.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/AHkdlfa/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BF931468B-46B2-4E40-9294-FAA4C7B16D4D%7D&file=Accessibility%20Review%20Agenda.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)
- 2020 late: SLA [approach](https://app.clickup.com/26475560/v/dc/t7z18-23888/t7z18-112148)
- 2021 mid: ["The road to a more inclusive web" blogpost](https://kdl.kcl.ac.uk/blog/state-digital-accessibility-kdl/)

### 2020 late Review meeting

Approximately 10 members involved over a 12 month period (2 team members working solely on accessibility for 6 months)

{% endslide %}

{% slide %}

## Project time comparison

- Legacy/post projects took 3-5 times longer
- Active projects seemed to take much less time

It was calculated it would take 4-5 years <br><br> to complete the [70+ more post projects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1--ku5lYoGUA-bGzK9xtziqd_dg0uFgYxyBKctEyuq3E/edit?gid=980906287#gid=980906287) with current resources.

{% endslide %}

## Actions

- Double checked legal compliance
  - Not legally required
- But decision was still to keep the same commitment
  - Post project work was shifted to [SLA](https://app.clickup.com/26475560/v/dc/t7z18-23888/t7z18-112148)

## Learnings

- Non-adaptive, rigid approach
- Lack of open dialogue and collaboration
- Focus on compliance
- Complex official resources
- Insufficient internal documentation
- Disproportionate work distribution
- Mismatched responsibilities
- Uneven knowledge and understanding
- Limited support

### WCAG

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), developed by the World Wide Web Consortium, are technical standards that help make the digital world accessible to people with disabilities. Numerous stakeholders, including disability advocacy groups, government agencies, and accessibility research organizations, collaborated to create these guidelines, which are considered the universal standard for digital accessibility.

- WCAG Versions 1.0 (1999), 2.0 (2008), 2.1 (2018) and 2.2 (2023)

- Three Levels of WCAG Conformance: A (minimum), AA (mid), and AAA (highest)

## Observations

All or nothing approach

- Avoidance

  - Feasibility - Reasons were given that accessibility wasn't needed in project requirements

  - Evolutionary Development - Not prioritised, often left to the end where there would be no time to work on

- Inconsistent outputs

  - very different processes

  - dependant of who was on the project

{% endslide %}

{% slide %}

### Updated approach

- 2023 early: [Strategy](https://emckclac.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/AHkdlfa/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B0F136034-6480-4CEB-8328-7004E5036D8D%7D&file=2023.06.22_KDL%20Digital%20Accessibility%20Strategy%20v3.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) and [Process](https://emckclac.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/AHkdlfa/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B5BD942CD-9C12-44F7-82B7-68222CEE7A01%7D&file=2023.02.08_KDL%20Digital%20Accessibility%20Process.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1) aligned with SDLC

# Strategy

{% endslide %}

{% slide %}

Our objective is to **cultivate a digital environment** that **enhances usability, inclusivity, and full compliance with accessibility standards**. The introduction of [new government regulations](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/contents/made) in 2018 prompted us at King’s Digital Lab to formally strengthen our accessibility approach.

Through continuous iterations, our current strategy aims to reach and benefit the broadest possible audience, supporting accessibility in a sustainable, scalable way, integrating it comprehensively with our Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and Agile methodology. We actively research the latest resources and seek user feedback to understand the needs and challenges with our digital offerings. This ongoing engagement informs our improvement updates to ensure alignment with evolving best practices and accessibility standards.

## 2. **Scope**

### [Kick off]

_Lead_ **_A_**_, Collaborate_ **_E U_**_, Consult_ **_R_**

{% endslide %}

{% slide %}

### Discuss with project team and determine what will be assessed during project Kick off

{% endslide %}

{% slide %}

- **Goals**: Discuss and agree on assessment goals. Are we aiming for a complete site audit or specific sections? Decide on full-site vs. targeted audit, and specify the compliance level (A, AA, AAA) to align with organisational and legal requirements.

- **Target Users**: Brainstorm and list user profiles, including those with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities. Discuss the specific accessibility needs these users may have, identify any assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers, magnifiers) they might use.

- **User Journeys:** Map and prioritize key user journeys, such as searching an archive, filtering data points. Ensure each journey is accessible end-to-end. Prioritize which flows to focus on based on user importance and frequency of use.

{% endslide %}

{% slide %}

- **Pages and Features**: Identify high-traffic pages, core user flows (e.g., checkout, login), and key interactive elements (e.g., forms, tables, multimedia). Create a checklist for multimedia (videos with captions), dynamic elements (pop-ups, forms), and images (alternative text).

- **Devices, Operating Systems, and Browsers**: Identify the primary devices, OS, and browsers based on to reflect real-world usage, analytics data or user feedback. Cover popular browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, focusing on both the latest and older relevant versions.

- **Content and Formats**: Review and list content types for accessibility checks, including text, images, multimedia, and interactive components.

- **Third-Party Components**: Identify any third-party integrations, such as chat or map widgets, embedded videos, or social media feeds. Determine which components need specific checks or alternative solutions.

{% endslide %}

{% slide %}

- **Technical Constraints**: Discuss any limitations posed by frameworks (e.g., R/eact, Angular) or the CMS that might impact accessibility implementation.

- **Responsiblities by Role:** List more specific role responsibilities. Decide how much collaboration or dependences will be needed.

- **Pages/Outputs:** List all the urls to test and statement link

- **Schedule:** Confirm how often or when to work on certain parts. e.g. testing, statement updates

{% endslide %}

{% slide %}

The scope should be checked at different points in the project, especially if there are changes to the requirements, to see if it still fits.

{% endslide %}

{% slide %}

### Time logging

It's important to get an overview across projects over time for better estimation and to know which areas to improve.

{% endslide %}

{% slide %}

Ensure tasks are set up in CU and split time estimates into subtasks in the main RQ task:

- **2: Scope**

- **3: Assess and fix** <br>_If done within the Evo Dev process, estimate roughly how long you took e.g. if you spent 5h developing or designing and did a few checks along the way, you might log 1h_

- **4: Documentation** <br>_First deployment even on stg/dev should have the barebones statement_

- **Assess**

  - **Automated Testing**: Use automated [accessibility tools](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/tools/list/) (like WAVE, Axe, WebVal or Lighthouse) to identify common issues, such as missing alt text, insufficient colour contrast, or missing form labels. These tools provide a broad initial scan but typically don't capture all accessibility barriers.

  - **Manual Testing**: Conduct manual checks to identify issues automated tools may miss, such as keyboard navigation functionality, screen reader compatibility, dynamic content accessibility (e.g. hover states, text over image). This stage often includes testing with assistive technology like screen readers (e.g., JAWS or NVDA) and magnifiers.

  - Stand alone assessments (fixes done separately) should be documented in CU.

- **Fix** when issue is found.

  - Any issues that cannot be fixed should be recorded directly to the statement.

  - Tools and methods should also be recorded in the statement.

Find the colours used in the code or take a screenshot and colour pick it in a tool like Photoshop or similar alternatives like [pixlr](https://pixlr.com/e/#editor).
Then put the hex colours in a tool like [https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
