# Digital Accessibility <br> Strategy and Process

<hr>

### KDL's updated approach

Alessandra Esposito, Geoffroy Noël, Tiffany Ong

{% endslide %}

{% slide %}

## History

- 2019: KDL's began an [approach to accessibility](https://emckclac.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/AHkdlfa/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B2F4D65D9-066F-440B-B50A-8F23F446470C%7D&file=Accessibility%20-%20Index%20Page.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)

- 2020 late: [Review meetings](https://emckclac.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/AHkdlfa/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BF931468B-46B2-4E40-9294-FAA4C7B16D4D%7D&file=Accessibility%20Review%20Agenda.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)

  - Approximately 10 members in 12 month period (2 solely on accessibility for 6 months). 4-5 years to complete [70+ more post projects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1--ku5lYoGUA-bGzK9xtziqd_dg0uFgYxyBKctEyuq3E/edit?gid=980906287#gid=980906287) with same resources.

  - Double checked legal compliance, Not legally required. Kept similar commitment but post project work was shifted to SLA [approach](https://app.clickup.com/26475560/v/dc/t7z18-23888/t7z18-112148).

  - Attempt to [documentation process](https://emckclac.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/AHkdlfa/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B61FD200C-3189-45CD-8B2C-628FBE9013F6%7D&file=2022.06.09_Process%20List_TO.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1) but not taken up.

- 2021 mid: ["The road to a more inclusive web" blogpost](https://kdl.kcl.ac.uk/blog/state-digital-accessibility-kdl/)

{% endslide %}

{% slide %}

## Observations

- Inconsistent outputs (All or nothing approach)

  - very different processes

  - dependant of who was on the project

- Deprioritisation/Avoidance

  - Feasibility - Reasons were given that accessibility wasn't needed in project requirements

  - Evolutionary Development - Not prioritised, often left to the end where there would be no time to work on

{% endslide %}

{% slide %}

## Learnings

- Non-adaptive, rigid approach
- Lack of open dialogue and collaboration
- Focus on compliance
- Complex official resources
- Insufficient internal documentation
- Disproportionate work distribution
- Mismatched responsibilities
- Uneven knowledge and understanding
- Limited support

## Strategy

Our objective is to **cultivate a digital environment** that **enhances usability, inclusivity, and full compliance with accessibility standards**. The introduction of [new government regulations](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/contents/made) in 2018 prompted us at King’s Digital Lab to formally strengthen our accessibility approach.

Through continuous iterations, our current strategy aims to reach and benefit the broadest possible audience, supporting accessibility in a sustainable, scalable way, integrating it comprehensively with our Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and Agile methodology. We actively research the latest resources and seek user feedback to understand the needs and challenges with our digital offerings. This ongoing engagement informs our improvement updates to ensure alignment with evolving best practices and accessibility standards.

## 1\. **Requirements**

[SDLC stage: Feasibility]

[Roles: _Lead_ **_A_**_, Collaborate_ **_E U_**_, Consult_ **_S_**]

### Determine the MoSCoW Digital Accessibility requirement needed during Feasibility

(Questionnaire could be given to partners at this stage)<br> <br>
(Estimates need to be updated to adapt for different project budgets/timelines)

{% endslide %}

{% slide %}

## MUST (**M**)

- meet WCAG **A/AA** criteria for the **majority** of components (few/none will not meet)
- perform specific accessibility assessments during evolutionary development
- produce a public accessibility **statement** and update it at each deployment
- Estimate **4 days** = A 1 | E 1.5 | U 1.5<hr>

        ✔ Has more than 5 users

        ✔ Has 1st party apps/platforms

        ✔ Has only non-complex components

        e.g. [Layers of Vision](https://layersofvision.org/), [KDLweb](https://kdl.kcl.ac.uk/),  [CultureCase](https://culturecase.org) ~28h

{% endslide %}

{% slide %}

### WCAG

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), developed by the World Wide Web Consortium, are technical standards that help make the digital world accessible to people with disabilities. Numerous stakeholders, including disability advocacy groups, government agencies, and accessibility research organizations, collaborated to create these guidelines, which are considered the universal standard for digital accessibility.

- WCAG Versions 1.0 (1999), 2.0 (2008), 2.1 (2018) and 2.2 (2023)

- Three Levels of WCAG Conformance: A (minimum), AA (mid), and AAA (highest)

Reference: [https://www.wcag.com/resource/what-is-wcag/](https://www.wcag.com/resource/what-is-wcag/)

{% endslide %}

{% slide %}

## SHOULD (**S**)

- meet WCAG **A/AA** criteria for **some** components (some might not meet)
- perform specific accessibility assessments during evolutionary development
- produce a public accessibility **statement** and update it at each deployment
- Estimate **3 days** = A 0.6 | E 1.2 | U 1.2<hr>

        ✔ Has more than 5 users

        ✔ Has 1st party apps/platforms

        ✘ Not only non-complex components

        e.g.  [Radical Translation](http://radicaltranslations.org/) (Data visualisation) 18-20h (incl fixes), [Alice Thornton](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk) (Digital Edition), [Field](https://field-wt.co.uk) (Game)

{% endslide %}

{% slide %}

## COULD (**C**)

- integrate basic digital accessibility requirements based on individual knowledge into the evolving solution
- **not** perform specific accessibility assessments
- produce a public accessibility **statement** and update it at each deployment
- Estimate **1 day** \= A 0.2 | E 0.4 | U 0.4<hr>

        ✔ Has more than 5 users

        ✘ Not using only 1st party apps/platforms

        e.g. [Living with Machines](https://observablehq.com/@jmiguelv/lwm-language-of-accidents#cell-3512) ~6h

{% endslide %}

{% slide %}

## WON'T (**W**)

- integrate basic digital accessibility requirements based on individual knowledge into the evolving solution
- **not** perform specific accessibility assessments but scope still needed
- **not** produce a public accessibility **statement**
- Estimate **0.3 days** = A 0.1 | E 0.1 | U 0.1<hr>

  ✘ No more than 5 users

## 2. **Scope**

[SLDC stage: Kick off]

Roles: _Lead_ **_A_**_, Collaborate_ **_E U_**_, Consult_ **_R_**

### Discuss with project team and determine what will be assessed during project Kick off

The scope should be checked at different points in the project, especially if there are changes to the requirements, to see if it still fits.

## 3\. **Assess/Fix**

[SDLC stage: Evolutionary Development]

Role: _Lead_ **_E U_**_, Collaborate_ **_A_**

All assessment and fixes should be integrated seamlessly, continuously when designing and developing within the evolutionary development work, ensuring checks are done before any deployment/increment.

{% endslide %}

{% slide %}

- **Assess**

  - **Automated Testing**: Use automated [accessibility tools](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/tools/list/) (like WAVE, Axe, WebVal or Lighthouse) to identify common issues, such as missing alt text, insufficient colour contrast, or missing form labels. These tools provide a broad initial scan but typically don't capture all accessibility barriers.

  - **Manual Testing**: Conduct manual checks to identify issues automated tools may miss, such as keyboard navigation functionality, screen reader compatibility, dynamic content accessibility (e.g. hover states, text over image). This stage often includes testing with assistive technology like screen readers (e.g., JAWS or NVDA) and magnifiers.

  - Stand alone assessments (fixes done separately) should be documented in CU.

{% endslide %}

{% slide %}

- **Fix** when issue is found.

  - Any issues that cannot be fixed should be recorded directly to the statement.

  - Tools and methods should also be recorded in the statement.

- Recent KDL examples:

  - using the [gov.uk template](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/model-accessibility-statement) took a long time to fill in, difficult to understand. [Alice Thornton](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/accessibility/), [COTR](https://cotr.ac.uk/accessibility-statement/)

  - using [generator tool](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/generator/#create) took shorter time but lots of repetition.
