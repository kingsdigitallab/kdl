Timebox = fixed period of time (2 weeks) allocated for completing a set of tasks across projects to deliver an increment or hit a milestone. At the start of each timebox, the whole Solution Development Team:
1. Review previous timebox
1. Plan current timebox based on current projects' priorities
1. [MoSCoW prioritisation](/faqs/#what-is-moscow-prioritization)
1. Workload review
