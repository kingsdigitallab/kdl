Zihao is a multidisciplinary designer and experimental artist whose work delves deeply into the intersections of space, race, and the boundaries that separate and connect people. With a keen ability to observe his surroundings, social dynamics, and human nature, Zihao critically reflects on these elements and expresses his insights through a wide range of media, including experimental film, performance, narrative art, photography, architecture, installation, and choreography.

His practice is driven by a relentless pursuit of deconstructing and reconstructing ideas, pushing the limits of his self-perception and professional disciplines. Each project becomes a bold exploration, challenging the conventional boundaries of identity, interaction, and form.
