Ginestra studied Graphic Design at IED Milan. While working as an Art Director in few Advertising Companies in Italy, such as TBWA Italia and Factory Group, she developed an interest in web technologies. The transition from traditional to digital design took some learning of PHP, HTML and CSS and led Ginestra to become a freelance Creative Designer, mixing her design knowledge with some coding. She worked at KDL as a Senior Research Software UI/UX Designer, having over ten years experience in the field of Web Design / Front-end Development. Her interests focus mainly on data visualisations, video interaction with HTML and responsive web design. Ginestra is also a co-organiser of London Web Standards, a non-profit organisation that provides monthly events for web enthusiasts and the annual conference State of the Browser.
