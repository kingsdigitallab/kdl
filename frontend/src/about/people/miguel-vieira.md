Miguel Vieira has worked in the digital humanities domain since 2006, when he took responsibility for the re-design of the XML development strategy at the then Centre for Computing in the Humanities at King's College London, though before that he was already developing software for libraries and archives.

He has expertise in designing, developing, and deploying web based projects, analysing and modelling humanities and unstructured data, natural language processing, machine learning, and systems administration.

He holds a degree in Engineering and Computer Sciences from the Universidade de Coimbra, and a BSc in Informatics and Systems Engineering from the Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Coimbra, Portugal.
