Arianna has over 15 years’ experience in collaborative Digital Humanities (DH) research, and 10 years’ experience in research management, and digital research infrastructures (inclusive of research policy strategy and implementation). She is an active member of the Research Software Engineers (RSE) and DH national and international communities; she researches and advocates for a holistic understanding of digital infrastructures and of modelling processes of cultural-historical objects and phenomena for the application of computational methods.

Her personal research interests focus on modelling processes (from data modelling to design and analysis). She lectured and published on humanities computing, in particular on digital manuscript studies and editing; she has organised conferences and workshops in digital humanities, and is an active member of its international community.

She holds a PhD in Manuscript and Book Studies (digital palaeography, University of Siena), an MA in Applied Computing in the Humanities (King’s College London) and a BA Hons in Communication sciences (computational linguistics, University of Siena).

She worked at King’s in the past as Research Associate (Centre for Computing in the Humanities, 2003-2009). From 2009 to 2012, she worked as Science officer at the European Science Foundation (Humanities) where her primary responsibilities included the supervision of instruments to fund collaborative research in the humanities and the coordination of strategic activities. From 2013 she worked as Research Facilitator at the University of Roehampton for three years, where she expanded the research funding portfolio and supported research strategies across the Humanities and beyond. She was appointed Director of KDL in 2022.
