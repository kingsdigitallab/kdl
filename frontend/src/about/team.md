King’s Digital Lab is home to an approachable team experienced in leading and collaborating in several Digital Humanities projects, from small starting grants to multi-million project bids.
Combining different personal backgrounds, both commercial and academic, we are at the fore front of exploring research avenues incorporating emerging technologies and new and, often, challenging ideas and directions with our project partners.
Located in the heart of London, KDL is housed within the Faculty of Arts and Humanities' REACH Space, on the main Strand campus of King’s College London.
