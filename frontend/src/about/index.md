King’s Digital Lab (KDL) is a Research Software Engineering (RSE) team in King’s College London. Based within the college's Faculty of Arts and Humanities and with a staff of thirteen full-time members our mission is to enable and deliver high quality digital research across the Faculty's domains. 

## KDL's work
We design and implement systems, infrastructure, tools, and processes needed to produce a heterogeneous range of digital scholarly outputs, including historical database, digital editions, data visualisations and infographics, georeferenced maps, natural language processing workflows, and immersive experiences. We also allocate a modest amount of resources to non-grant-funded activities within Faculty and the college, including technical consultancy, development, peer review, archiving and sustainability, and increasing staff and students’ capabilities. (For more information on our Research Services Catalogue see [this blogpost](https://kingsdigitallab.github.io/kdl/blog/snapshot-mission/).)

## Teams and roles
KDL's technical (or Solution Development) team includes research analysts and software engineers, designers and systems managers, and they are supported by a project manager, Lab manager, and Director (Lab Support team). We have found this wide spectrum of roles vital for running a Lab which at any one time can have around 20 projects under active development, 30 funding proposals being prepared, 60 projects in various post-funding states.

## Partners and collaborators
As well as working with people and groups within Faculty (and King's as a whole) we also engage widely with other higher education institutions, with libraries, museums, and cultural heritage bodies, and with the performing arts and creative industries sector. The [projects directory](https://kingsdigitallab.github.io/kdl/projects/) showcases a large breadth of projects and methods we are working on or have been involved with   We are typically funded by external grants to work on collaborative projects with partners, and are very grateful to several organizations that have supported our work over the years. (See the [partners and funders](https://kingsdigitallab.github.io/kdl/about/partners-and-funders/) page.)

## Communities
The Lab's progenitors at King's were firstly the Centre for Computing in the Humanities and then the Department of Digital Humanities, and KDL continues to be actively involved in the digital humanities (DH) world through dissemination of research, contributions to conferences and networks and participation in groups such as [UK Ireland Digital Humanities Association](https://digitalhumanities-uk-ie.org/). We are also increasingly engaged with groups such as [RSE Society UK](https://society-rse.org/) and believe there are mutual benefits in the DH and RSE worlds coming closer together.

## Research interests
The rapid and widespread changes in 'the digital' constantly open up new areas of interest for the Lab. Team members are currently exploring a variety of pathways which include  Digital Creativity (see for example [Digital Ghost Hunt](https://digitalghosthunt.com/) project, [Room is Sad](https://kingsdigitallab.github.io/kdl/blog/room-sad/) blogpost), AI and Machine Learning (see for example [Critical Modelling of Extensive Literary Data](https://kingsdigitallab.github.io/kdl/blog/cmeld-ae/) blogpost), and Indigenous Digital Humanities (see [this blogpost](https://kingsdigitallab.github.io/kdl/blog/indigenous-digital-humanities-research-theme-under-development/) on that emerging research theme).
