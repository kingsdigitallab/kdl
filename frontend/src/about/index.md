King’s Digital Lab (KDL) is a Research Software Engineering (RSE) team in King’s College London. Based within the college's Faculty of Arts and Humanities and with a staff of thirteen full-time members our mission is to enable and deliver high quality digital research across the Faculty's domains. 

## KDL's work
We design and implement systems, infrastructure, tools, and processes needed to produce a heterogeneous range of digital scholarly outputs, including historical database, digital editions, data visualisations and infographics, georeferenced maps, natural language processing workflows, and immersive experiences. We also allocate a modest amount of resources to non-grant-funded activities within Faculty and the college, including technical consultancy, development, peer review, archiving and sustainability, and increasing staff and students’ capabilities. (For more information on our Research Services Catalogue see this blogpost.)

## Teams and roles
KDL's technical (or Solution Development) team includes research analysts and software engineers, designers and systems managers, and they are supported by a project manager, Lab manager, and Director (Lab Support team). We have found this wide spectrum of roles vital for running a Lab which at any one time can have around 20 projects under active development, 30 funding proposals being prepared, 60 projects in various post-funding states.

## Partners and collaborators
As well as working with people and groups within Faculty (and King's as a whole) we also engage widely with other higher education institutions, with libraries, museums, and cultural heritage bodies, and with the performing arts and creative industries sector. The LINKprojects directory showcases a large breadth of projects and methods we are working on or have been involved with   We are typically funded by external grants to work on collaborative projects with partners, and are very grateful to several organizations that have supported our work over the years.

## Communities
With the Lab's progenitors at King's being firstly the Centre for Computing in the Humanities and then the Department of Digital Humanities, KDL has always had strong bonds with the digital humanities through dissemination of research, contributions to conferences and networks with active participation in relevant communities such as RSE Society UK and UK Ireland Digital Humanities Association. THIS OK BUT NEEDS MORE, POSS ALONG LINES THAT WE ARE KEEN TO BRIDGE DH & RSE

## Research interests
We are particularly keen in expanding our portfolio around Digital Creativity (see for example Digital Ghost Hunt project, Room is Sad blogpost), AI and Machine Learning (see for example Critical Modelling of Extensive Literary Data blogpost), and Indigenous Digital Humanities (see this this blogpost on our emerging research theme).
