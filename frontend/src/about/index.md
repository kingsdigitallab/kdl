King’s Digital Lab (KDL) is a Research Software Engineering (RSE) team in King’s College London. Based within the college's Faculty of Arts and Humanities and with a staff of thirteen full-time members our mission is to enable and deliver high quality digital research across the Faculty's domains. 

## KDL's work
We design and implement systems, infrastructure, tools, and processes needed to produce a heterogeneous range of digital scholarly outputs, including historical database, digital editions, data visualisations and infographics, georeferenced maps, natural language processing workflows, and immersive experiences. We also allocate a modest amount of resources to non-grant-funded activities within Faculty and the college, including technical consultancy, development, peer review, archiving and sustainability, and increasing staff and students’ capabilities. (For more information on our Research Services Catalogue see this blogpost.)

## Teams and roles
KDL's technical (or Solution Development) team includes research analysts and software engineers, designers and systems managers, and they are supported by a project manager, Lab manager, and Director (Lab Support team). We have found this wide spectrum of roles vital for running a Lab which at any one time can have around 20 projects under active development, 30 funding proposals being prepared, 60 projects in various post-funding states.
