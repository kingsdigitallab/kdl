The Digital Creativity Research Theme brings together Analysts and Research
Software Engineers in KDL to create immersive, Mixed Reality (MR) experiences
with partners in the Creative Industries, Higher Education, and GLAM sectors.
Its objective is to develop the Lab’s creative and XR capacity to collaborate
on research projects with academic partners, primarily in the Arts & Humanities.
