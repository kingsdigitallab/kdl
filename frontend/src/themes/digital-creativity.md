The Digital Creativity Research Theme brings together Analysts and Research
Software Engineers in KDL to create immersive, Mixed Reality (MR) experiences
with partners in the Creative Industries, Higher Education, and GLAM sectors.
Its objective is to develop the Lab’s creative and XR capacity to collaborate
on research projects with academic partners, primarily in the Arts & Humanities.

Future areas of interest for the theme will focus on immersive experiences with
real time engines, Virtual Production, and the creation of immersive and
multi-media experiences which foster engagement, drive research impact and
promote knowledge sharing. KDL is interested in exploring all applications of
these technologies and in working to understand how they can be used to enrich
our shared research goals.

Some technologies used in this theme:

- Real time engines and 3D tools. Primarily Unreal Engine, with some Unity support, as well as Blender, used for immersive and Virtual Production.
- Embedded systems and making: 3D printing, electronics and work with microcontrollers such as Raspberry Pis and Micro:Bits
- VR/AR in Unity/Unreal Engine, as well as WebXR with A-frame and Three.js
- Digital Surrogates: 3D Photogrammetry and LiDAR capture of heritage assets
