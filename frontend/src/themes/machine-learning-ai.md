The Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Research Theme focuses on creating
a virtual cycle within KDL’s Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) around ML and
AI that goes beyond single projects solutions across the triangle of critical,
analytical and practical RSE-driven research. Its primary objectives include
leveraging past experiences and emerging best practices to guide project scoping,
planning, and execution, formalising and sharing AI/ML knowledge and guidance
internally and globally, innovating new computational methods and software tools
for AI/ML research.
