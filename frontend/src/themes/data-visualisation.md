The Data & Processes Visualisation Research Theme explores the use of visual tools and techniques to represent complex datasets and processes in ways that enhance understanding, support analysis and interpretation, and drive communication and storytelling. It addresses challenges such as visual perception, interactivity, accessibility, data literacy and the ethical implications of representing and knowing with data. Visualisations can reveal the constructedness, fuzziness and relationality of data and help inform diverse audiences; they can also influence and skew perceptions of the information they present. The work of this theme both employs and critically examines existing and emerging practices in this important field.
