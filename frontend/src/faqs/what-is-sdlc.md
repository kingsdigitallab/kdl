KDL follows a methodology with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software. This Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) comprises three main phases of a project's life: Pre-project, Active, and Maintained. Each main phase typically contains a number of steps. The diagram below gives an overview of the main phases and the steps within them, and other sections in this FAQ give more detailed information about individual steps.

### Project phases

1. Pre-project
2. Active
3. Maintained

- ### Initial contact

  Tell us as much as you can about your project idea, even if it’s at an early stage.

  [Contact us](/contact-us/)

- ### Internal assessment

  Do the project’s idea, time frame and strategic fit make it a good match for KDL?

- ### Requirements assessment

  An in-depth discussion to define requirements, if feasible, leading to a Product Quote.

- ### Funding application

  The Product Quote will have most information you need. We can help write and check relevant sections.

  (_Skip this step if funding is available._)

- ### Kick off

  Once funding is confirmed, we’ll plan how to work together and what to focus on first.

- ### Evolutionary development

  The actual development. Dividing the project into increments, we decide at the end of each which requirements we'll focus on in the next increment.

- ### Deployment

  We aim to deploy a portion of the project after each increment.

  This cycles with Evolutionary Development, moving back and forth between stages.

- ### Final release

  Final changes and testing, and confirming post-project support. We’ll agree a final release date and any support for launch activities.

- ### Post project

  We plan and cost for a period of hosting and maintenance from the start.
