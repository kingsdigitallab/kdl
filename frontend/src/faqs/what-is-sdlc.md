KDL's Software Devlopment Lifecycle (SDLC) is.....

### Project Phases

1. Pre-Project
2. Active
3. Maintained

- ### Initial Contact

  Tell us as much as you can about your project idea, even if it’s at an early stage.

  [EMAIL US](mailto:kdl-info@kcl.ac.uk?Subject=Enquiry)

- ### Internal Assessment

  Do the project’s idea, time frame and strategic fit make it a good match for KDL?

- ### Requirements Assessment

  An in-depth discussion to define requirements, if feasible, leading to a Product Quote.

- ### Funding Application

  The Product Quote will have most information you need. We can help write and check relevant sections.

  (_Skip this step if funding is available._)

- ### Kick Off

  Once funding is confirmed, we’ll plan how to work together and what to focus on first.

- ### Initial Contact

  The actual development. Dividing the project into increments, we decide at the end of each which requirements we'll focus on in the next increment.

- ### Deployment

  We aim to deploy a portion of the project after each increment.

  This cycles with Evolutionary Development, moving back and forth between stages.

- ### Final Release

  Final changes and testing, and confirming post-project support. We’ll agree a final release date and any support for launch activities.

- ### Post Project

  We plan and cost for a period of hosting and maintenance from the start.
