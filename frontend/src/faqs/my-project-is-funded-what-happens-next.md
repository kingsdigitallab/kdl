Your project will have a dedicated Solution Development Team (SDT) drawn from KDL staff. This core team usually comprises a research software analyst, a research software developer, and a research software UI/UX designer. The analyst leads the KDL side of the project, coordinating the work of the development team and handling associated communications and internal documentation. In addition to the SDT, you will also have dealings with the KDL Project Manager (who acts as main contact for process-oriented queries, team workflow planning across projects as well as first point of escalation) and the KDL Lab Manager who handles all the financial aspects as well the post-funding life of the project's digital outputs. 

 

A kickoff meeting with the SDT and Project Manager will explain KDL's incremental development process and documentation and will plan initial increments and deliverables.
