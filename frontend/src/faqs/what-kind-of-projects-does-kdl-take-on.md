KDL works on various kinds of projects where the common thread is a need for digital outputs to present scholarly research or digital methods to enable scholarly research on textual, image and multi-modal datasets (see our [projects list](/projects/)). Our work encompasses data models, data structures, data processing (including machine learning and AI, Natural Language Processing, code reviews), a variety of interfaces for data analysis, interpretation and publication (including data visualization, storytelling, digital maps, digital editions), and XR applications.
