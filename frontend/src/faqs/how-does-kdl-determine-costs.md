The different perspectives and combined experience the team brings to proposal drafting and reviewing helps us produce reliable estimates of the number of work days needed to meet each requirement and then the cost is calculated using the appropriate day rate for the funding context. KDL is a [TRAC-listed](https://www.trac.ac.uk/about/) research facility and our daily rates for funders are set by XXXX and agreed with Faculty.
