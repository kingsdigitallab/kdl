KDL offers the option to maintaining the project under a costed Service Level Agreement (SLA). Usually the SLA is costed at pre-project phase and an email is sent out to request signatures prior to release. For SLA renewals partners are usually contacted 6-months before it expires. We offer agreements of variable durations depending on project age, infrastructure requirements, and PI preference but our standard SLA duration is five years. Typically, an SLA with KDL includes Support and Troubleshoot (e.g. issues with hosting and CMS) as well as periodic renewals and updates (e.g. hosting, licenses, frameworks, libraries).

Other options for archiving and sustainability are also possible and can be explored on a case by case basis (see more details on our [archiving and sustainability approach](/our-work/archiving-sustainability/)).
