New project ideas appear from a range of different sources, including one-to-one relationships developed between KDL team members and colleagues at King's College London and beyond. If you think someone in KDL might be particularly interested in your project idea, feel free to drop them a line; however, the team is very busy and managing our workload can be difficult, so in most cases it's easiest to send an email to our generic address (kdl-info@kcl.ac.uk) or use the [contact form](https://forms.clickup.com/26475560/f/t7z18-888/8C8AHFIVVZLW8NTIWA) on our website. We will usually get back to you within a week.
