New project ideas appear from a range of different sources, including one-to-one relationships developed between KDL team members and colleagues at King's College London and beyond. If you think someone in KDL might be particularly interested in your project idea, feel free to drop them a line; however it is usually easier to reach us via the [contact forms](/contact-us/). We will usually get back to you within a week.
