At the end of the deployment phase, the project enters the 'final release' stage. This includes any final changes and testing which are covered during 'Change Freeze'. This allows time for quality check, test and deliver a high quality solution. It is the stage where no more new features can be added as we are nearing the end of the project. An email will be sent out alerting partners about change freeze when 70-80% of the project is complete.

After that, we will agree on a final release date and any support for launch activities.
