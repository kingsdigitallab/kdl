Upon successful [Feasibility Assessment](/faqs/#what-happens-after-kdl-takes-on-a-project) KDL will give you a Product Quote. This document has the same information as the Feasibility Assessment but is set out as a formal agreement which will be signed by you and KDL. The Product Quote will help you write your case for support, budget, and workplan.

If agreed in advance, KDL may also contribute to data management plans or equivalent technical documentation required by the relevant funding scheme.
