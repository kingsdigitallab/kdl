KDL always welcomes new ideas for involvement in prospective projects. If your project idea involves a funding application, then it is best to contact KDL - preferably viaâ€¯the website [contact form](https://forms.clickup.com/26475560/f/t7z18-888/8C8AHFIVVZLW8NTIWA) - at least 3 months prior to the deadline. This will allow us time to discuss your idea and assess its feasibility (see also following question). That said, we do understand that some funding calls come out at short notice, or the need for a digital output may become apparent later in the application process. If your deadline is short or you have some budget to spend quickly, please flag this and we will do what we can to work with you.
