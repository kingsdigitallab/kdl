When you first contact KDL please briefly tell us what the project is about, why it is important, who is involved, and (if applicable) whether youâ€™d like a KDL team member to act as co-Investigator and when you plan to submit a funding application. It is also helpful for KDL to know about the likely nature, format, and quantity of datasets and other material you intend to use in the project. This is especially true if some or all of the datasets and other materials have already been collected / worked on. Details about the funding source and budget are also useful, if they are available.
