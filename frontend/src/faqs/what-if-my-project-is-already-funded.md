We will consider your project as described in ‘How does KDL decide whether to take on a project?’. LINK TO THAT QUESTION If we take it on, we will follow a process similar in parts to our Feasibility Assessment LINK PHRASE ‘FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT TO RELEVANT SECTION but quicker. The output in this case will be a Statement of Work with a MoSCoW-prioritized LINK PHRASE ‘MOSCOW-PRIORITIZED’ TO RELEVANT SECTION list of requirements tailored to the available budget. And like our Product Quote LINK PHRASE ‘PRODUCT QUOTE’ TO RELEVANT SECTION, the Statement of Work is a formal agreement which will be signed by you and KDL.
