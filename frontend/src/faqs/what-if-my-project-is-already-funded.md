We will consider your project as described in [How does KDL decide whether to take on a project?](https://kingsdigitallab.github.io/kdl/faqs/#how-does-kdl-decide-whether-to-take-on-a-project). If we take it on, we will follow a process similar in parts to our [Feasibility Assessment](https://kingsdigitallab.github.io/kdl/faqs/#what-happens-after-kdl-takes-on-a-project) but quicker. The output in this case will be a Statement of Work with a [MoSCoW-prioritized](https://kingsdigitallab.github.io/kdl/faqs/#what-is-moscow-prioritization) list of requirements tailored to the available budget. And like our [Product Quote](https://kingsdigitallab.github.io/kdl/faqs/#how-does-kdl-help-with-a-funding-application), the Statement of Work is a formal agreement which will be signed by you and KDL.
