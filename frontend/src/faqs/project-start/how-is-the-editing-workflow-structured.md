As summarised in the table below, KDL produces three environments for your project, each one running a slightly different copy of your website (or online resource):

- **Production (or Live)**: for your public facing site, which you can update on a regular basis;
- **Staging**: for a private copy of the site where you and other partners can test new functionalities and editing your research database;
- **Development**: used internally by KDL for development in progress or, occasionally, to give you a preview of upcoming features.

This staged set up improves the quality of your research output by ensuring that changes to your research data and the underlying software are first tested safely and then approved before being released to the general public.

Content type for each server: Column one has content type, other columns show the version of content available on each server

Server

Dev

Staging

Production/Live

Software (e.g. search page, data visualisation, editorial tools)

New software features are **tested** by KDL before being released to Staging

New version of software is **tested and approved** by partners before being released Live

Research database (e.g. digital edition, tabular data, metadata)

Research data can often be freely **prepared** and previewed by partners on staging before being released Live

Contextual content (e.g. blogs, news, about, home page or navigation menus)

Partners can usually **draft** and **publish** their contextual content directly on the Live site using a Content Management System (e.g. Wagtail)
