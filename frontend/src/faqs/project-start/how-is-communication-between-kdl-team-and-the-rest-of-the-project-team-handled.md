Once a project has started, regular review meetings are organised by KDLâ€™s project analyst and associated documentation is kept up to date using project templates and the project and task management tool. Information is shared with partners to elicit feedback, initiate testing, and review progress.

Communication also takes place via email, outside regular review meetings. KDL project manager should be the main contact for process-oriented issues and financial queries while the KDL project analyst should be the main point of contact for any issues related to the development work. Please ensure the appropriate person or parties in the project team are contacted throughout the project. As we work with an iterative process, swift feedback after each increment is essential for the project to progress efficiently.
