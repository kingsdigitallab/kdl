KDL contribution to scholarly outputs and other research products should be credited appropriately. KDL recommendations and practices are:

- Partner’s responsibility: ‘About’ on project site page should include names of KDL staff who are closely involved with the project and the nature of their contribution (see list of [KDL team members](/who-we-are/))’.
- KDL’s responsibility: Website footer; ‘Technical overview’ page describing the technical development and design processes; project description page with KDL roles on KDL website (see examples on KDL site ‘[Our work](/our-work/)’); humans.txt file integrated with project website templates.
- All: credit partner(s)/relevant KDL team members in publications connected to the project; include partner(s)/relevant KDL team members as co-authors when their contribution is substantial (e.g. KDL team members should be included as co-authors in conference papers, posters or articles describing the technical development or other aspects of the project they contributed to).
