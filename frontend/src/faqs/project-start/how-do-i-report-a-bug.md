A good bug report contains the following information: browser & operating system, date & time, URL, complete sequence of actions on the web page to reproduce the bug, expected result vs actual result (screenshots also help). For further guidance see for example [https://blog.testlodge.com/how-to-write-a-good-bug-report/](https://blog.testlodge.com/how-to-write-a-good-bug-report/)

To report a bug in your project site please contact the project analyst. To report a bug in any other site hosted by KDL please [email us](mailto:kdl-info@kcl.ac.uk)Â or use [this report issue form](/report-issue/).
