At the end of KDL feasibility assessment, partners receive a product quote defining methodological and technical requirements, and the nature of KDL involvement: solution architecture; development and management approaches; delivery plan; hosting and maintenance as well as archiving and sustainability plans; costs of KDL involvement including management and infrastructure charges as appropriate.

If agreed in advance, KDL also contributes extensively to data management plans or equivalent technical documentation required by the relevant funding scheme.
