In principle we can but we would need to assess it. It would be extremely useful if you could prepare an inventory of your content and documentation about your datasets (e.g. columns in a spreadsheet, notational conventions) and the size and format of your data (e.g. JPG, CSV, XML, ...). We can start working from representative samples while the full dataset is being collected. However late changes in the structure or format of your data and delays in its delivery can disrupt the development schedule.
