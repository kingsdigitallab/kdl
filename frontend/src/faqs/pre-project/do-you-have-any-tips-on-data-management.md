The responsibility for the research data management plan stays primarily with the research partners but, as part of KDL's feasibility phase, we would like to review it and are happy to assist or provide guidance.

For partners based at King’s College London, the [KCL guideline on research data management](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/library/researchsupport/research-data-management/index) should be consulted.
