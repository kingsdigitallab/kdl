We host a variety of projects based around different technologies, Java web projects, TEI projects, and Python/Django projects. Since before its official establishment in 2015, we have been standardising our core technology stack and most of the recent and new projects are built with Python/Django, Foundation/Bootstrap for UI/UX, and Vue.js for certain frontend functionality. We are open to use other technologies as needed to fulfil project requirements; however, if we need to deviate from the core technical stack mentioned above, implications for sustainability should be assessed accordingly.
