title: Why can't we contact KDL team members to propose projects directly?

New project ideas appear from a range of different sources, including one to one relationships developed between KDL team members and colleagues at King's College London and beyond. If you think someone in KDL might be particularly interested in your project idea feel free to drop them a line. The team is very busy, though, and managing our workload can be difficult. For that reason all project ideas, whether received via email or our [contact us web form](/contact-us/), are discussed at our weekly project planning meeting. This is the most important meeting the lab holds. We think through each project as a team, and work out how it aligns to our yearly goals, workflow, funding strategy, as well as the personal and technical interests of team members. In most cases it's easiest to send us an email (kdl-info@kcl.ac.uk) or use the web form and open your idea to the whole team - that way everyone gets a chance to consider it.
