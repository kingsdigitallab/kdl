KDL welcome new ideas for projects anytime (preferably via [the contact us form](/contact-us/); if these are funding proposals, KDL should be contacted as prospective partner 3-month prior to the deadline. This will allow us to discuss your idea and assess its feasibility.

We follow a 2-phase decision making process in which we decide if we can accept a new project to our portfolio. Firstly, we discuss all project proposals in our weekly project planning meeting to review if it fits within our research strategy, expertise and resource capacity. If we feel the project is a good fit, weâ€™ll present the project to the Arts & Humanities Faculty for further discussion after which the final decision is made on our contribution to your project.

Project Planning meetings with Faculty are held every 6 weeks. This means you could have to wait several of weeks before we can confirm whether we can work on your project proposal. When you contact us, we will let you know when you can expect our answer so that you can plan for this in your submission timeline.
