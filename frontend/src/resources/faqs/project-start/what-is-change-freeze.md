The change freeze, sometimes also called code or feature freeze, occurs following the prioritisation of the final requirements for the project to allow for time to quality check, test and deliver a high quality solution. It is the stage where no more new features can be added as we are nearing the end of the project. An email will be sent out alerting partners about change freeze when 70-80% of the project is complete.
