MoSCoW is a well known prioritisationÂ technique which categorises requirements into four categories (Must have, Should have, Could have, and Won't have). MoSCoW is often used with timeboxing, where a deadline is fixed so that the focus must be on the most important requirements. All requirements are important, but they are prioritised to deliver the greatest and most immediate business benefits early. See [https://www.agilebusiness.org/content/moscow-prioritisation](https://www.agilebusiness.org/content/moscow-prioritisation) for more details on the Agile DSDM use of MoSCoW. We will initially try to deliver all the Must have, Should have and Could have requirements but the Should and Could requirements will be the first to be removed if the delivery timescale looks threatened.
