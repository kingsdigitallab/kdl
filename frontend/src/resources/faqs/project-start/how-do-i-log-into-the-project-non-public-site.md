Please let the project contact (normally the analyst) knowÂ title and affiliation of every partner who needs access to the editorial site. We will send them an email with a link to reset their password. That links **expires rapidly** and it takes us time to reissue it. Please make sure every member does it on time and **takes note of their username and password**.
