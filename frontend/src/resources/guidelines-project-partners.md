This questionnaire helps initiate a collaboration with King's Digital Lab (KDL).

Depending on whether you are exploring the opportunity to include digital
outputs as part of your research or have already a developed idea to do so, and
at what stage you are of the funding process, answering the following set of
questions will inform the KDL team on how to better assess our involvement.

The more information you are able to provide, the better. This will allow KDL
to move more quickly from initial contact to producing a quote.

We welcome early conversations about potential projects and KDL can assist in
exploring answers to questions you leave blank.

KDL can also be involved with research projects in other ways, e.g. providing
expert advice or running workshops on digital methods.

KDL operates as a TRAC Facility. Our daily rate for research projects ranges
between £826 and £984.

Being based in the Faculty of Arts and Humanities at King’s College London or
planning to involve as co-lead in your project someone based in the Faculty
will affect the rate at which KDL will be costed for this collaboration. The
rate is lower for leads/co-leads based in in the Faculty of Arts and Humanities
(which can include a KDL member), while it is higher if you are based in
another Faculty or at an external institution.

VAT could be applicable, depending on the nature of our collaboration.
